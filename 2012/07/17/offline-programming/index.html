    <h1>Offline programming</h1>

    <p>This is the first in an n-series of posts about programming while offline. I&rsquo;ll be posting about issues and solutions to these issues that I come across.</p>

<h4>Why?</h4>

<p>I recently bought a house but it&rsquo;s not quite ready to move into yet. My wife and I also expecting our first child and since we&rsquo;ve already gone through the process of finding a doctor and hospital and what not to have the baby at we&rsquo;re just not ready to move. However, we go there just about every weekend. Little things that need to be done such as the lawn. Receiving furniture. Minor remodeling.</p>

<p>With the length of time I spend there I don&rsquo;t feel justified in paying for internet access just yet.</p>

<p>This has led to a small conundrum. I am unable to develop the same there as I do at my apt.</p>

<p>Almost every project I have relies on access to Nuget. CDN hosted js files such as jQuery. Most of my public projects are hosted on Github.</p>

<h4>Simple solutions</h4>

<p>Nuget is easy enough to replace by downloading all of the packages that I use onto a removable drive. Access is generally slower than Nuget.org because it has no index to search.</p>

<p>CDN hosted files could be hosted locally as well but with changes to how I&rsquo;m pointing to them.</p>

<p>Github hosted projects are probably the easiest because git makes this nice and easy. I can push all of my commits at a later time, however it does mean I need to pull my repos to a removable drive.</p>

<h4>Other issues</h4>

<p>A lot of my projects also revolve around Amazon&rsquo;s AWS. It&rsquo;s what we use at work. I love trying out new things related to their offerings but there&rsquo;s no <em>emulation</em> mode available to do offline testing.</p>

<p>I also love to read about technologies that I don&rsquo;t know about or would like to learn more about. I&rsquo;ve been reading about Redis and Memcached and other similar libraries/services. Harder to read about them offline.</p>

<p>I also tend to chat a lot with other devs about issues I might be having with some code. I don&rsquo;t have internet on my phone and find phone keyboards to be too awkward anyway to chat on anyway so that&rsquo;s a non-issue. This will make collaboration a bit harder.</p>

<h4>However</h4>

<p>Sometimes you need a break from all the distractions. The latest Youtube video viraling out of control on the internet or funny cat pictures won&rsquo;t consume some of my precious time. No email from work.</p>

<p>Twitter won&rsquo;t interrupt me with the latest technology or blog post written by one of my peers. Every weekend I miss out on all the interesting stuff that may have happened. I&rsquo;ve made it a rule to just ignore it. I don&rsquo;t go back and browse the history of what I might have missed. (Unless it was directed at me specifically)</p>

<h4>Final</h4>

<p>So far offline development hasn&rsquo;t been a picnic. Lots of downsides with a few upsides. I&rsquo;ll be going over these in more detail when/if I find better ways around them.</p>
