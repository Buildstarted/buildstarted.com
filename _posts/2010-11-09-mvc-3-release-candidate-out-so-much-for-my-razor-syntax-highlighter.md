title: Mvc 3 release candidate out so much for my razor syntax highlighter
---

<p>Well, the time has come for me to bow down to those who truly rock. The wonderful team at Microsoft has finally released their <a href='http://haacked.com/archive/2010/11/09/asp-net-mvc-3-release-candidate.aspx'>official version</a> of the Syntax Highlighter (with Intellisense) for MVC's Razor. There isn't much I can do to improve upon their version.</p>

<p>I want to thank everyone for their support in downloading and trying out my extension for Visual Studio. I was <strong>so</strong> close to 3000 downloads! Alas...</p>

<p>Please, everyone who has a chance, should upgrade as soon as possible. </p>
