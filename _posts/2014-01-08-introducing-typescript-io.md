title: Introducing Typescript.io
---

For the past couple weeks I've been working on a sort of jsfiddle for Typescript. Most of that time has been working on the intellisense features for typescript. It's amazing what the designers of Typescript made available.

The UI is fairly simple. You have your typescript, html, css editors and a results pane. You can hide/show them as necessary. All prototypes are private by default.

I am currently working on adding user login support so you can save you prototypes.

Here are a couple sample prototypes you can use.

Please mention any bugs you find. I'll try and fix them as I can.

I hope you enjoy this site and share it around.
