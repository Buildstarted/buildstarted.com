<h2>Entity Framework Primary key but not auto-increment</h2>

<p>I ran into an interesting problem today with regards to an Entity Framework model having a Primary Key that was not auto-increment.</p>

<p>As a test I created the following model:</p>

<pre><code>public class Person() {
    [Key] public int ID {get;set;}
    public string Name {get;set;}
}
</code></pre>

<p>I created a table in sql2008 with the exact same structure and I executed the following code. The primary key is an integer but is not auto-increment</p>

<pre><code>var owner = new Person() { ID = 1, Name = "Owner" };
db.People.Add(Person);
db.SaveChanges();
</code></pre>

<p>Using sql profiler I was able to see the sql being generated by Entity Framework</p>

<pre><code>exec sp&#95;executesql N'insert [dbo].[People]([Name])
values (@0)
select [ID]
from [dbo].[People]
where @@ROWCOUNT > 0 and [ID] = scope&#95;identity()',N'@0 varchar(50),@0='Owner'
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see there's no ID being passed to the query</p>

<p>What I ended up doing was having to set the following code in the <code>OnModelCreating</code> method</p>

<pre><code>modelBuilder.Entity<Person>()
            .HasKey(p => p.ID)
            .Property(p => p.ID)
            .StoreGeneratedPattern = StoreGeneratedPattern.Identity;
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps anyone else out there.</p>
