title: Razor syntax highlighting
---

<p>I�ve been using MVC a lot lately and specifically using the Razor View Engine. One of the issues I have with it is that there is no syntax highlighting yet. It�s not that big of a deal though as you can change the document type to always open with the Html Editor and you, at least, get Html syntax highlighting. However that wasn�t enough for me. It�s still a bit hard to see the code vs. the html so I whipped together this little extension and I hope you get as much use out of it as I do. <a href="http://buildstarted.com/razor-syntax-highlighter/">Click here</a> to go to the article.</p>
