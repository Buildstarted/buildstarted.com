title: Parrot 1.0 Release
---

I'm proud to announce that Parrot is going 1.0 this week. It went through a lot of changes to get it here. Several major "rewrites" of portions of the system to handle usages I had not conceived of while writing.
The more interesting change was the removal of the dependency resolver. Thanks to [GrumpyDev](http://www.grumpydev.com/) for his help in that area.

###Javascript
One of the more interesting releases is that of a javascript parrot parser. It can be used in webpages or possibly with nodejs once a wrapper is written.
Including the required files and jQuery makes it as simple as 

    var html = $("#template").parrot();
	
You can then insert it in your webpage just like any html string.

    $("body").html($("#homepage").parrot());

Here's how it's used on the home page for [Parrot](http://thisisparrot.com/).

###Nancy
Also with this release a version of the Parrot View Engine for the [NancyFx](http://nancyfx.org/). Porting Parrot over to Nancy was one of the ways I found everything that could be wrong with Parrot. This caused several rewrites as I realized I was really dependent on Asp.net.
I think this has streamlined how it works. 


###Asp.Net
And of course, there's support for Asp.Net MVC.

So checkout the website at [http://thisisparrot.com/](http://thisisparrot.com/) and check it out for yourself.
