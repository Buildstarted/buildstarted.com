Gists are just like any repository.

I was editing a gist recently when I thought. `There's got to be a better way!` So I tried to clone my gist from the command line using the following command.

`git clone git@gist.github.com:<gistid>`

Turns out that's valid! Since I own the gist as well I can push to it just like **any** other repository on git.

This is really awesome since I write gists often.
