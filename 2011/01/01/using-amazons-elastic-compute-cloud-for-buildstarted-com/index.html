    <h1>Using amazons elastic compute cloud for buildstarted com</h1>

    

<p>After a few outages of my previous host I&rsquo;ve decided to move my server to Amazon&rsquo;s <a href='https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/'>EC2</a> services. I have to tell you it was <strong>not</strong> an easy transition. I was more than confused with the array of options on Amazon&rsquo;s services.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to go over exactly the choices I&rsquo;ve made and what I did to get it working.</p>

<h2>Type of machine</h2>

<p>This site isn&rsquo;t the most popular on the internet so I don&rsquo;t need anything really powerful. Here are the systems available for websites:</p>

<table id='instances' style='width:100%;' cellpadding='3' cellspacing='0'>
<thead><th>Type</th><th>Ram</th><th>Processors</th><th>Storage</th><th>Platform</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr class='micro'><td>Micro</td><td>613MB</td><td>Up to 2 ECUs (for short periodic bursts)</td><td>EBS only</td><td>32 or 64 bit</td></tr>
<tr><td>Small</td><td>1.7 GB</td><td>1 ECU (1 Virtual core with 1 EC2 Compute Unit)</td><td>160 GB local storage</td><td>32 or 64 bit</td></tr>
<tr><td>Large</td><td>7.5 GB</td><td>4 ECUs (2 virtual cores with 2 EC2 Compute Units each)</td><td>850 GB local storage</td><td>64 bit</td></tr>
<tr><td>Extra Large</td><td>15 GB</td><td>8 ECUs (4 virtual cores with 2 EC2 Compute Units each)</td><td>1690 GB local storage</td><td>64 bit</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to go with the <strong>Micro</strong> server. It&rsquo;s cheap (currently free for one year) and it fits my needs. I haven&rsquo;t had another asp.net referral for a while though (<em>hint</em>, <em>hint</em>) so I might need to upgrade to a small server when that time comes. Incidentally that&rsquo;s one of the great things about Amazon&rsquo;s service: I can change the server type at a whim <strong>without</strong> reconfiguring the system.</p>

<h2>AMI&rsquo;s</h2>

<div style='text-align:center;'><a href='https://aws.buildstarted.com/instancelist.png'><img src='https://aws.buildstarted.com/instancelist.png' style='width:100%;' /></a></div>


<p>AMI&rsquo;s or Amazon Instance Machines are the bases for any system you wish to start up on EC2. There are a wide range of over 6000 different systems available on the Community AMI list from Windows to Linux and even OpenSolaris to custom server types like a default wordpress and joomla setups. I chose a blank Ubuntu setup as that is what I&rsquo;m familiar with and I know what I&rsquo;m getting since I&rsquo;ll be forced to install everything myself.</p>

<h3>Setting up your new machine</h3>

<p>The first step in setting up your new machine is to choose what type of instance you want.</p>

<div style='text-align:center;'><a href='https://aws.buildstarted.com/instancetype.png'><img src='https://aws.buildstarted.com/instancetype.png' style='width:100%;' /></a></div>


<p>You have a selection, based on your chosen ami, of what type of machine you want. This is really powerful as a single AMI can be any type of system you want. So if your site is small - like this one - but it gets really popular you can either add new instances of the same type for load balancing <em>or</em> you can just change the type of machine your instance runs on. I can&rsquo;t figure out how the hell they do this but it&rsquo;s damn awesome.</p>

<h4>Kernel/Ram</h4>

<div style='text-align:center;'><a href='https://aws.buildstarted.com/instancedetails.png'><img src='https://aws.buildstarted.com/instancedetails.png' style='width:100%;' /></a></div>


<p>I have no clue exactly what this is. I just use the default Kernel and RAM Disks. Here you can enable CloudWatch which allows you to see detailed information on disk/ram/network usage while your machine is running.</p>

<h4>Machine Tags</h4>

<div style='text-align:center;'><a href='https://aws.buildstarted.com/instancekeys.png'><img src='https://aws.buildstarted.com/instancekeys.png' style='width:100%;' /></a></div>


<p>Here you can add some tags. The default one of Name always works well. Tags are really only useful if you have a lot of different instances in your list and you want to quickly find instances based on a particular attribute.</p>

<h4>Key pairs</h4>

<div style='text-align:center;'><a href='https://aws.buildstarted.com/instancekeypair.png'><img src='https://aws.buildstarted.com/instancekeypair.png' style='width:100%;' /></a></div>


<p>Here you can create a key pair for remote access to your system. This doesn&rsquo;t require you to remember a username or password - which, as we&rsquo;ve seen with the recent <a href='https://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2010/12/the-dirty-truth-about-web-passwords.html'>Gawker incident</a>, is never a good idea. Store your keypairs in a safe place. When you ssh with a client such as PuTTY you&rsquo;ll set your auth to your keypair you&rsquo;ve created here.</p>

<h4>Firewall</h4>

<div style='text-align:center;'><a href='https://aws.buildstarted.com/instancefirewall.png'><img src='https://aws.buildstarted.com/instancefirewall.png' style='width:100%;' /></a></div>


<p>Setting up your instance firewall allows you to open ports to your instance and make it available to the internet or a select ip range. I&rsquo;ve opened up HTTP and SSH here as all I would need is a cheap web server and nothing more. Though I&rsquo;ve selected <strong>All Internet</strong> for both options I would recommend you only use a port range for something like SSH. But for testing, who cares? :)</p>

<h4>Launch</h4>

<div style='text-align:center;'><a href='https://aws.buildstarted.com/instancereview.png'><img src='https://aws.buildstarted.com/instancereview.png' style='width:100%;' /></a></div>


<p>This page is just a review of what you&rsquo;ve selected on the previous pages with the option to go back and make changes if you screwed up somehow. If everything is good you just need to click <strong>Launch</strong>.</p>

<h3>EBS Storage</h3>

<p>All <strong>Micro</strong> Instances must be stored using EBS. I didn&rsquo;t know what this meant at first but I understand now. I did a lot of extra stuff after I setup my server such as backing up my wordpress database once a day and restoring the database on boot. I found that this isn&rsquo;t necessary as EBS instances are more permanent and store stuff on your EBS storage. This does introduce possible other costs but this website exists mostly in cache so it&rsquo;s not really an issue. For instance-only storage for some AMI&rsquo;s any changes to the filesystem do <em>not</em> persist when the machine is shut down. This is a very important distinction. Since you can use Instances for stuff other than hosting, like data processing, it may or may-not be necessary.</p>

<h2>Costs</h2>

<table id='instances' style='width:100%;' cellpadding='3' cellspacing='0'>
<tr><th>Costs</th><th>Linux Hour</th><th>Windows Hour</th><th>Linux Year</th><th>Windows Year</th></tr>
<tr><td>Micro</td><td>$.02</td><td>$.03</td><td>$175.20</td><td>$262.80</td></tr>
<tr><td>Small</td><td>$.085</td><td>$.12</td><td>$744.60</td><td>$1051.20</td></tr>
<tr><td>Large</td><td>$.34</td><td>$.48</td><td>$2978.40</td><td>$4204.80</td></tr>
<tr><td>Extra Large</td><td>$.68</td><td>$.96</td><td>$5956.80</td><td>$5956.80</td></tr>
</table>


<p>The above costs are for instances that haven&rsquo;t been reserved. Windows costs are all slightly more per hour than Linux.</p>

<table id='instances' style='width:100%;' cellpadding='3' cellspacing='0'>
<tr><th>Reserved Costs</th><th>1 Year</th><th>3 Years</th><th>Linux</th><th>Windows</th><th>Linux Year</th><th>Windows Year</th></tr>
<tr><td>Micro</td><td>$54.00</td><td>$82.00</td><td>$.007</td><td>$.013</td><td>$61.32</td><td>$113.88</td></tr>
<tr><td>Small</td><td>$227.50</td><td>$350.00</td><td>$.03</td><td>$.05</td><td>$262.80</td><td>$438.00</td></tr>
<tr><td>Large</td><td>$910.00</td><td>$1400.00</td><td>$.12</td><td>$.20</td><td>$1051.20</td><td>$1752.00</td></tr>
<tr><td>Extra Large</td><td>$1820.00</td><td>$1820.00</td><td>$.24</td><td>$.40</td><td>$2102.40</td><td>$3504.00</td></tr>
</table>


<p>The above costs are for reserved instances. You can purchase an instance ahead of time, such as a small, for a one time fee. In return you get a discount price per hour for the length of your purchase. Windows prices may fluctuate over the course of your contract, however. I was thinking about reserving a Micro instance as the savings is quite significant over the course of 3 years at a savings of over 50%. However, thinking about it more and more&hellip;if this site gets more popular over time I may need to change from Micro to Small - in which case my reserved instance is no longer the savings machine it was. Just something to think about. I doubt I&rsquo;ll need anything more than my Micro but you never know&hellip;it&rsquo;s up to the community to <strong>make</strong> me upgrade. However, doing the math, even if I needed to upgrade the server from Micro to Small in 6 months I would still save money by reserving an instance.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t do that though - the Micro is currently free to new subscribers to Amazon&rsquo;s EC2 service</p>

<h2>Final</h2>

<p>As I learn more about this process I will post more. This whole setup has brought up some questions that I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll find the answers for over time (I&rsquo;ll probably head over to <a href='https://www.serverfault.com/'>serverfault.com</a> and ask them!) I&rsquo;m currently finalizing another site that I intend to host on Amazon&rsquo;s EC2 service that will be much more popular. (I hope) So I should have a chance to test stuff like upgrading the server to a more powerful machine and what not to see how that works.</p>
