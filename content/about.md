I'm just a lowly programmer.

I live in Southern California with my beautiful wife and a beautiful daughter.

I've been programming professionally for about since about 2000 but non-stop since about 1995.
I've worked on various things throughout the years. My initial goal was to develop video games. I found
that I'm no good at it and was much better at business.

I have a few open source projects. You can find most of them on Github. I currently love developing in
c# and javascript.

There really isn't much more to say just now - I'll flesh this out later :)
