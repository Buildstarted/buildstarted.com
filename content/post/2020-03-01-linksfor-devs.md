title: Introducing linksfor.dev(s)

For the past year I've been working on a small site called [linksfor.dev(s)][1]. Some quick background on why.

I quit social media a few years ago and mostly disappeared from the internet at the same time. The platforms I was on didn't provide the filters
necessary for me to cut out noise and vitriol from my feeds. In order to improve my sanity I simply had to cut myself off.

That's where [linksfor.dev(s)][1] came in. It's an automated process that looks at various sources around the internet, vetted by me, gathers
all the links and drops them into a nice interface. Most of the links on the site are automated but occasionally I get a link from a friend
or other source and add them manually.

With the help of the wonderful people on <span title="That migrated to Slack">`OG JabbR`</span> I've refined the process and added many features
that I think make the service a lot better.

The site is hosted on [Github Pages][2] and statically generated using Razor. There are no comments or voting: just pure information.

This site is mainly for me so if you enjoy it then great! If you have any issues you'd like to report please post it on the [issues page][3].
