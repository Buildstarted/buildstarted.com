Some quick background on why.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I quit social media a few years ago and mostly disappeared from the internet at the same time. The platforms I was on didn&amp;rsquo;t provide the filters
necessary for me to cut out noise and vitriol from my feeds. In order to improve my sanity I simply had to cut myself off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s where &lt;a href="https://linksfor.dev">linksfor.dev(s)&lt;/a> came in. It&amp;rsquo;s an automated process that looks at various sources around the internet, vetted by me, gathers
all the links and drops them into a nice interface. Most of the links on the site are automated but occasionally I get a link from a friend
or other source and add them manually.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the help of the wonderful people on &lt;span title="That migrated to Slack">&lt;code>OG JabbR&lt;/code>&lt;/span> I&amp;rsquo;ve refined the process and added many features
that I think make the service a lot better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The site is hosted on &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages&lt;/a> and statically generated using Razor. There are no comments or voting: just pure information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This site is mainly for me so if you enjoy it then great! If you have any issues you&amp;rsquo;d like to report please post it on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/buildstarted/linksfordevs">issues page&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New blog, who dis?</title><link>/post/2020-02-26-newblog-who-dis/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/2020-02-26-newblog-who-dis/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m back!
