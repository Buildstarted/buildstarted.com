		<title>Introducing linksfor.dev(s)</title>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;For the past year I've been working on a small site called &lt;a href="https://linksfor.dev"&gt;linksfor.dev(s)&lt;/a&gt;. Some quick background on why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quit social media a few years ago and mostly disappeared from the internet at the same time. The platforms I was on didn't provide the filters
necessary for me to cut out noise and vitriol from my feeds. In order to improve my sanity I simply had to cut myself off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's where &lt;a href="https://linksfor.dev"&gt;linksfor.dev(s)&lt;/a&gt; came in. It's an automated process that looks at various sources around the internet, vetted by me, gathers
all the links and drops them into a nice interface. Most of the links on the site are automated but occasionally I get a link from a friend
or other source and add them manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the help of the wonderful people on &lt;span title="That migrated to Slack"&gt;&lt;code&gt;OG JabbR&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt; I've refined the process and added many features
that I think make the service a lot better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site is hosted on &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt; and statically generated using Razor. There are no comments or voting: just pure information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site is mainly for me so if you enjoy it then great! If you have any issues you'd like to report please post it on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/buildstarted/linksfordevs"&gt;issues page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

a project I've been working on.&lt;/p&gt;
